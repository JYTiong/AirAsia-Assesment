Question 9
Overloading allows for the user to use the same name for a function as long as it has a different type of argument(s), while overriding allows the user to change a method's implementation while using the same name and parameters.
Example:
Overloading
int add(int x, int y){
	return x + y;
double add(double x, double y);
	return x + y;

Overriding
class Animal {
	public void walk() {
		System.out.println("Animal is walking");
	}
}

class Dove extends Animal {
	public void walk() {
		System.out.println("Dove is walking");
	}
